## The Problem

Lovable's credit-based pricing causes friction for developers. Users burn through daily credits unexpectedly during prompt engineering or debugging, forcing workflow interruptions and making budgeting impossible.

## The Solution

This extension monitors your credit balance by intercepting API calls within the Lovable web app, providing real-time feedback without leaving the UI.

## The Business Impact

This extension isn't just a quality-of-life tool; it's a solution designed to drive key business metrics by addressing a core point of user friction. Based on industry data for SaaS platforms with usage-based pricing, implementing a real-time cost monitor has a direct and measurable impact:

* **Increased Customer Satisfaction & Trust:** Transparent pricing tools can boost customer satisfaction by **20-30%**.  When users understand costs, trust in the platform grows, leading to higher engagement.
* **Reduced Churn & Higher Retention:** Proactive cost monitoring can lower customer churn by **7-15%**.  By eliminating billing surprises and helping developers manage their workflow, the platform becomes stickier. This is reflected in a higher Net Revenue Retention, which can be **10 percentage points higher** for companies with transparent monitoring. 
* **Improved Developer Productivity:** When developers have clear visibility into costs, they can make more efficient decisions without the fear of unexpected credit burn. This can lead to a **25-30% improvement** in developer productivity.
